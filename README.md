Hi, I'm **Pietro**, a Computer Science student at **UniFe** with a strong passion for technology, programming, and especially **algorithms**.

I really enjoy **software development**, particularly exploring Linux systems, tools, and libraries. I love building projects, experimenting with new technologies, and continuously learning. Most of my personal and open-source work is available here on GitHub.

I'm always open to feedback, collaborations, and discussions—so feel free to reach out if you’d like to talk tech or exchange ideas!
